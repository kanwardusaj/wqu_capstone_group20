# Wqu Capstone Group20 - Emperical Test to Debunk the weak form of EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS
This GIT report is for the Research Track (Capstone Research Paper) and the area of study chosen is to model the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and bring to light myths associated with the hypothesis that do not necessarily reflect the reality in the performance of investments on the market. Several myths are associated with the EMH which we seek to debunk in this project and also throw more light on the concept and other competitive concepts that operate contrary to established theories associated with the EMH. This choice has been informed by our keen interest as a group in the performance of investors on the market and how their very actions affect the performance of the entire market amidst changes in securities information. With this, we are looking forward to establish various myths associated with the EMH, debunking same and establish facts to add up to existing literature in addressing the competition on the market and how changes in information affect investors as well as their reactions to same.
